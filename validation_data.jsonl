But when the evil had spread from one place to another, and had taken such a hold upon men that it almost entirely swept away the whole population, those persons, seeing others die in great numbers, and being in constant fear of death, began to consider how they might avoid it, or at least put it off as long as possible. And the expedient to which they had recourse was to quit their own homes and families, and to retire to a country residence which belonged to one of them, standing at a distance from any habitation, or even any frequented road. Here they proposed to dwell, counting on their good fortune in having previously escaped the contagion; and, taking with them what was necessary for their daily subsistence, they closed the doors and windows, resolved to hold no communication with anyone outside, and to spend their time in all sorts of merriment and feasting, and amusing themselves with music and such other diversions as they could devise. Each of them took with him a servant, so that they were in all seven persons; and as there were four ladies and three gentlemen, the former took the kitchen departments, and prepared the meals with the assistance of the servants, whilst the gentlemen devoted themselves to such other occupations as seemed best calculated to pass the time agreeably."}]}
